    "### Different types of Python Inheritance\n",
    "There are 5 different types of inheritance in Python. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Single inheritance__: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Multiple inheritances__: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritances. \n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Multilevel inheritance__: When we have a child and grandchild relationship. This means that a child class will inherit from its parent class, which in turn is inheriting from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4.Hierarchical Inheritance__: When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__5.Hybrid Inheritance__: Inheritance consisting of multiple types of inheritance is called hybrid inheritance."
